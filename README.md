## Introduction

Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization repository! This project aims to provide insights into the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing and visualizing relevant data using Python. By exploring various aspects of the pandemic, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of its impact.

## Features

- Interactive data visualization using Python.
- Exploration of COVID-19 trends and patterns.
- Utilization of advanced analysis techniques.

## Data Sources

We rely on reputable and up-to-date data sources to ensure the accuracy of our analysis. The data sources used include:

- [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19): This dataset provides global and country-level COVID-19 statistics.

- [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus): An extensive collection of COVID-19 datasets and visualizations.

## Installation

To run the analysis scripts and notebooks in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/the-nightc0der/Covid-Analysis.git
   cd Covid-Analysis
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Covid-Analysis
   ```

2. Run Jupyter notebooks:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Explore the notebooks to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data.

## Models Used

### Compartmental Models

Our analysis employs compartmental models to simulate and understand the spread of COVID-19:

- **SEIR Model**: The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model is used to model the progression of the disease through various stages.

### Machine Learning

We leverage machine learning techniques to enhance our predictions:

- **Linear Regression**: We use linear regression to predict future COVID-19 trends based on historical data.
